# Gen AI Workshop Projects

Welcome to my collection of projects from the **Gen AI Workshop**! This repository showcases various applications of Generative AI, developed over a two-day workshop.

## **Day 1: Introduction to Generative AI & Basics**

### 1. **AI-Generated Poems**
**Description:** This Python script generates creative poems using predefined templates. The user is prompted to enter a fun word, which is then inserted into a randomly selected template to create a unique poem.

- **Concepts Covered:** Random selection, string formatting, user input handling.
- **Project Link:** [poem.py](https://github.com/Sharonsunaina7/GenAI_Model/blob/main/poem.py)

**How It Works:**
1. The script defines a list of poem templates with placeholders.
2. It prompts the user to input a fun word (e.g., "robot," "star," "AI").
3. A random template is selected from the list.
4. The user's word is inserted into the template using string formatting.
5. The final poem is displayed to the user.

*Example Output:*
```
Enter a fun word (e.g., robot, star, AI): star

AI-generated poem:

Twinkle twinkle little star,
AI helps in ways so bright!
```

### 2. **AI-Generated Jokes**
**Description:** This Python script creates humorous jokes based on user input. The user provides a fun word, which is inserted into a randomly chosen joke template, resulting in a personalized joke.

- **Concepts Covered:** Random selection, string formatting, interactive user experience.
- **Project Link:** [joke.py](https://github.com/Sharonsunaina7/GenAI_Model/blob/main/joke.py)

**How It Works:**
1. The script defines a list of joke templates with placeholders.
2. It prompts the user to input a fun word (e.g., "banana," "light bulb," "AI").
3. A random template is selected from the list.
4. The user's word is inserted into the template using string formatting.
5. The final joke is displayed to the user.

*Example Output:*
```
Enter a fun word (e.g., banana, light bulb, AI): banana

AI-generated joke:

Why did the banana go to school? Because it wanted to be a little brighter!
```

### 3. **AI-Generated Stories**
**Description:** This Python script crafts short stories by incorporating user-provided words into predefined story templates, resulting in engaging and personalized narratives.

- **Concepts Covered:** Random selection, string formatting, user input handling.
- **Project Link:** [story.py](https://github.com/Sharonsunaina7/GenAI_Model/blob/main/story.py)

**How It Works:**
1. The script defines a list of story templates with placeholders.
2. It prompts the user to input a fun word (e.g., "dragon," "spaceship," "AI").
3. A random template is selected from the list.
4. The user's word is inserted into the template using string formatting.
5. The final story is displayed to the user.

*Example Output:*
```
Enter a fun word (e.g., dragon, spaceship, AI): dragon

AI-generated story:

Once upon a time, in a land far away, a dragon discovered the magic of AI and transformed the world forever.
```
